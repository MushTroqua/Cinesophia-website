# Cinesophia: *Gising na*

A website I made for a film project for school using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

## How to download files:

If you need your own copy of the files, then it's as easy just pressing on the **green** button, and **Download ZIP**.
You'll see a ZIP file pop up in your download files.Extract where you want it to be, and edit using your favorite code 
editor (Or you can use Notepad, whatever works).

**Note: I am not exactly a great coder so beware of confusing code :D**
