# Cinesophia: *Gising na*

A website I made for a film project for school using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## How to download files:

If you need your own copy of the files, then it's as easy just by:
1. Pressing on the **green** button on the top left that says **Code**.

2. Press on **Download ZIP**.You'll see a ZIP file pop up in your downloads.

3. Extract where you want it to be, and edit using your favorite code editor.

Personally, I use Atom, but you can either use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.1.9/) for Windows, and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) for Apple
devices.

> Of course you can also use your default text editor but that's boring.

**EDIT** (January 12, 2024): I'd like to clarify that this is mostly CSS and HTML, with JavaScript for the faux timer that appears on the top right. I don't expect to be anything rather than my attempt of a website
with the time I was given. There is no backend, and it only serves as a prop that appears a couple of seconds in the movie.
