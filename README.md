# Cinesophia: *Gising na*

A website I made for a film project for school using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## How to download files:

If you need your own copy of the files, then it's as easy just pressing on the **green** button, and **Download ZIP**.
Extract where you want it to be, and edit using your favorite code editor (Or you can use Notepad, whatever works).

***Disclaimer: I am not a great programmer and there are some areas which are repeated which can be simplified
to one line.***
